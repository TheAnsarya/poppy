--- Run `~init.txt` prompts;

during research, save all URLs and resources to a `docs/resources.md` file; continue working, updating logs, docs, etc;

continue working the github issues and todolists (and making more) and work for a long time;

always use the most modern versions of languages and libraries and modern practices, so don't use dotnet 8, use dotnet 10 and c#14, etc; continue and work for a long time; do the "next steps"; update github issues and todo lists and documentation and update chat and session logs; go go go;

use k&r braces, so the operning brace is on the previous lines, not its own line; fix all code, reformat with the right rulews, k&r, tabs, lowercase, etc; make a ton of github issues and epics and sub issues, update plans, and todo-lists, and documentation and update session/chat logs; make sure to make issues and research all the advanced asm code stuff like labels, includes, advanced includes (using asset files) routinue names from jumps, comments, directives (like this file is NES, SNES LoRAM, etc.); continue working issues and todos and create a complete "how to use" manual for the compiler and build pipeline; continue and continue for a long time working on issues; make the project file like the `GameInfo` per game project file that includes assets etc, and code and so allows for a full build, so the compiler should use the disassembly code organized by functionality/section and maybe kick off asset conversion scripts, but can also have no assets or and continue and work issues;

create actual github issues from the `md` files that list the `gthib issues` and the `github issues enhanced`; and then work on those issues; for a long time; continue;

create `git-commit`s with descriptions in logical batches and git commit all files, connecting every git commit to a github issue, update documentation of commits to work features; create actual github issues from the `md` files that list the `github issues` and the `github issues enhanced` add all of them, then create subissues and todolists and plan all of the work needed; and then work on those issues; for a long time; continue;

update the github issues and todo-lists, create new issues and todos, every piece of work and every commit should be associated with an issue; keep working on `poppy` the compiler and all her extensive comprehensive documentation and issues and project file format; continue;

plan and update roadmap and create documentation and create a bunch of github issues for all the work that's about to occur and todo-lists and plan and commit and issue up! then work on those issues; and create a bunch of sub-issues in the github issues and update all plans and todo lists ad documentation and then implement all that work; write that code and file format docs and implement and doc everything for a while;

the assembly code files used with `poppy` should be named `*.pasm` instead of `*.asm` to indicate that they are using our disassembly file formatting; continue working all those files; continue working issues; go go go;  write that code and file format docs and implement and doc everything for a while; continue and work issues;

continue working issues;

--- try again

continue!;

use k&r braces! contune and accomplish a whole lot, updating issues and todo lists and chat/session logs and documentation, go for a while to reach our goal of a custom comprehensive assembler that fits our work flow in GameInfo so we can replace the other compilers for our projects;

use k&r braces! update and close issues that are done, update all the other issues that have work done, make sure to add issues for all work if an issue doesn't exist, document anything and everything, update the syntax documentation (it references `*.asm` files not `*.pasm` files in the examples, and are those `.arch` directive cannon?); I don't like that macros don't have a prefix, fix that; continue with more work and go for a while, keep going, document everything!;

-- switch from claude sonnet to claude opus

-- try again

use k&r braces! update issues, create sub issues for every remaining epic, and analyze the project and create more epics and sub issues to cover they rest of the roadmap, update the roadmap with the ability to compile and run the build pipeline for the projects from the `GameInfo` repository and update the `GameInfo` repos to use poppy (these are only issues/documentation/todo-lists, don't implement yet until we have a strong standalone assembler/compiler/build-tool); make sure the tests actually test if the code completes correctly, and results are match expected values, not just that it completes without an error; continue with more work and go for a while, keep going, document everything!;

create `git-commit`s with descriptions in logical batches and git commit all files, connecting every git commit to a github issue, update documentation of commits to work features; continue with more work and go for a while, keep going, document everything!;

continue;

pick a random issue and work on it; continue;

dangit, ***stop putting opening braces on their own line***, use K&R braces instead, format the whole project; pick another issue and implement it, maybe a couple of issues; continue;

pick several random issues and implement them; continue;

pick several random issues and implement them; continue;

add a documentation reference to `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RedCMD.tmlanguage-syntax-highlighter` did we use this? we should! (see comment #1 on issue #53); continue implementing issues, maybe 5 at a time;

use yarn, not npm;

continue implementing issues, maybe 5 at a time; go for a while

try again but limit your queries so we don't hit response length limits; continue previous work;

hey! always put timestamps in the chat log so I know what happened when and if something is stuck; Update the NES example project `examples/nes-hello-world` with an actual font graphics include that aligns with ascii so that the example works, and truly displays "HELLO WORLD!" when compiled and run; don't make examples that are incomplete, they should be compilable and runnable; Create plans and roadmap and documentation and research and references for the future version of poppy 2.0 in order to add new systems to the compiler: Atari 2600, Genesis, SMS, GBA, GBColor, WonderSwan, WSX, Atari Lynx, TG16, etc.; continue;

Use EST/EDT instead of UTC on the timestamps; Take the epic issue #47 `[Epic] VS Code Extension` and create a bunch of plans, documentation, and sub-issues, and them implement them; continue;

Do issues #74, #73, and add tests to #67; continue;

Hey! stop trying to edit `C:\Users\me\source\repos\poppy\~docs\poppy-manual-prompts-log.txt`. That file is mine and mine only, never update it; go through the github issues and assign their `parent` as to the appropriate issue/epic; Now update the issues for the `VSCode extension` for the work that has already been done, update todolosts, descriptions, labels, comments and status; then continue work on the `VSCode extension` issues;

No, you can update issues directly and close them! You have access! Make sure the github MCP is updated and upe the apis if that doesn't help! then return then the work we just paused; continue;

DO NOT EDIT `C:\Users\me\source\repos\poppy\~docs\poppy-manual-prompts-log.txt` stop it! leave it alone! hands off! fucking just don't!; No, you can update issues directly and close them! You have access! Make sure the github MCP is updated and upe the apis if that doesn't help! If it is an authorization issue, I can reconfirm the credentials, you've done it a million times before, do it now; then pick an important epic and update/create subissues and documentation and todolists and then implement it; continue;

you have github credentials! use them! attempt to login and give me a prompt I can use to log in so you have access!; then resume;

I'm authenticated, do the issue updating and closing!;

I've restarted, update guthub issues and close issues that are marked/commented for closure

what happened to the comprehensive `README.md` file? did you revert some files or merge in a bad branch? fix that file and whatever else you reverted;

The svg icon you made sucks, use a version of `🌸` instead and use `🌸` directly in documentation when an image isn't needed; then pick an important epic and update/create subissues and documentation and todolists and then implement it; continue;

sorry, accidental stoppage, continue where you were; continue;

add to editorconfig and markdown lint file `MD040 - Fenced code blocks should have a language specified` as true and `MD032/blanks-around-lists: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines` as true and `MD058/blanks-around-tables: Tables should be surrounded by blank lines` as true and then then format all of the files using `editorconfig` and `markdownlint`; then update the plans and road map and github issues and then continue with work on issues and previous work; continue; 

I see you are replacing tabs with spaces, or changing 2 spaces to 4 spaces. DON'T DO THAT. always use TABS for indentation, never use SPACES; TABS NOT SPACES; This rule (use tabs, not spaces, and use a 4 space tab) should be the primary rule for this entire project and every other project I make, it is god's law; now reformat and then resume previous work/prompt; continue;

do a quick check of the poppy project for the SNES compatibility and add a few epics, github issues, and the add roadmap, plans, documentation, and tons of sub-issues for this work effort (sub-issue means that the issue has a parent issue (usually an epic)), and then work on it and after work on the documentation to have comprehensive docs for SNES projects and compilation; work those new issues!; continue;

Create a "how to finish" document with a giant todo-list of tasks needing to be done in order to finish this v1.0.0 version of poppy, vscode extension, and plan the additional  todolists and github issues make all the issues (with a parent issue, labels, status, priority, etc); once you've made all of that docs/lists/issues sutff implementing the plan, actually start doing all of that work; continue;

What? No don't fake the tests, never fake the tests, just create a todolist for fixing those tests that have issues; continue what you were doing, the how to finsih stuff

--- switch to claude 4.5, try again

yarn, document this, always use yarn, not npm/npx;

Switch to using the Unlicense for our project, and copy it to the vscode extension as well; create sub-issues for issue #48 `[Epic] Game Boy Support` and then implment them; update all related issues, todolists, and documents; continue;

verify or implement with subissues the epics at issues #46, #11, #10, #9 and #13 and close the ones that are completed after working on them; continue;

verify or implement with subissues the epics/issues #46, #69, #13, and #83 and close the ones that are completed after working on them; continue;

do one last pass to make sure the `v1.0.0` version is ready for release; finish issue #47 `[Epic] VS Code Extension`, create the package and publish the extension to the `VS Code marketplace` and finish the documentation; once the documentation is done, create the Release on github and commit everything; update the roadmap and plans; then prepare for a roadmap and plans for working towards version 2.0.0;

update the primary `readme.md` file, for instance the `Coming Soon` section is out of date, we're in version 1.0.0, so update all the documentation to reflect the current state; then resume the work; Create plans and roadmap and documentation and research and references for the future version of poppy 2.0 in order to add new systems to the compiler: Atari 2600, Genesis, SMS, GBA, GBColor, WonderSwan, WSX, Atari Lynx, TG16, SNES SPC700, etc.; continue;

&&&
pause; install the `vsce` utils so we can publish the vscode extension by running:
```
cd vscode-extension
vsce login TheAnsarya
vsce publish  # Will publish poppy-assembly-1.0.0.vsix to marketplace
```
then continue working on previous prompt and work;
&&&

then continue working on previous prompt and work;

Make sure to update issues, epics, todolists, chat/session logs, documentation (document!) and create a ton of sub-issues snd todos that are all linked to a parent issue, usually an epic, and implement that code starting with atari 2600, atari lynx, WSX, WSC, and then genesis and bigendian; continue;


















create code/project convertors to the the poppy format from xkas, asar, ophis, and ca65 and check if there are other other popular assemblers for these systems;











The main `README.md` should have a comprehensive rework but reuse most of the content in this file or a sub documentation file and lets leave things colorful and graphical, start with a header and description, then a disclaimer/warning that the `*.psm` format and the poppy project file format are still in flux, then a Table of Contents index of the documentation in this file, and put specifics in the ub documentation files, the readme should be able to reach all documentation in the link web, prioritize (put early) the usage of the poppy project, such as "how to use" starting with vscode, vscode extension, download release, what next?;
