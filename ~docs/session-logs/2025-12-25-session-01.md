- ✅ Created 8 GitHub issues for remaining work:
	- #1: Set up GitHub Issues and Projects
	- #2: Create GitHub Projects Kanban Board
	- #3: Create Issue Templates
	- #4: Create Pull Request Template
	- #5: Create CONTRIBUTING.md Guidelines
	- #6: Add LICENSE File
	- #7: Document Branching Strategy
	- #8: Create Commit Message Conventions Documentation

---

## Pending Tasks

### Immediate (Now GitHub Issues)
All immediate tasks have been completed and converted to GitHub issues:
- ✅ #1: Set up GitHub Issues and Projects
- ✅ #2: Create GitHub Projects Kanban Board
- ✅ #3: Create Issue Templates
- ✅ #4: Create Pull Request Template
- ✅ #5: Create CONTRIBUTING.md Guidelines
- ✅ #6: Add LICENSE File
- ✅ #7: Document Branching Strategy
- ✅ #8: Create Commit Message Conventions Documentation

### Short-term
1. Work through GitHub issues #1-#8
2. Set up kanban board and add issues
3. Create feature branch for documentation work
4. Implement issue templates

### Long-term
1. Implement workflow for feature branches
2. Refine processes based on usage
3. Add automation where beneficial
4. Maintain documentation as project evolves

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Documentation Strategy:** Two-tier approach
	- `~docs/` for meta-documentation about project creation
	- `docs/` for project-specific documentation

2. **Coding Standards:** K&R style with tabs
	- Opening braces on same line as declaration
	- Tab indentation (never spaces)
	- Lowercase hexadecimal values
	- UTF-8 with CRLF line endings

3. **File Organization:** Keep logs organized by date
	- Chat logs: `YYYY-MM-DD-chat-NN.md`
	- Session summaries: `YYYY-MM-DD-session-NN.md`

---

## Notes

- This is a generic project base, avoiding unnecessary complexity
- Focus on essential tooling and documentation only
- All documentation follows established formatting standards
- Manual prompts log is user-maintained, AI should not edit

---

## Next Session

Will focus on:
- Creating comprehensive roadmap
- Initializing git repository
- Setting up GitHub integration
- Defining project-specific requirements (if any)
